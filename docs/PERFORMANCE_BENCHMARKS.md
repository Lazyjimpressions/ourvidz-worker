## **üìã Testing Protocol**

### **Standard Performance Test**

```yaml
Test Environment:
  - Hardware: RTX 6000 ADA (48GB VRAM)
  - Software: Latest worker code from GitHub
  - Models: Production models on network volume
  - Queue: Upstash Redis (production)

Test Procedure:
  1. Submit job through frontend
  2. Record start time (job received)
  3. Monitor worker logs for phase timings
  4. Record completion time and file details
  5. Document performance metrics
  6. Repeat for statistical significance

Metrics Recorded:
  - Total duration: Start to completion
  - Model loading time: T5 + VAE + WanModel
  - Generation time: Actual content creation
  - File operations: Save and upload
  - Output quality: File size, format, dimensions
  - Success/failure status
```

### **Performance Validation Checklist**

```yaml
Before Testing:
  ‚úÖ System fully operational (both workers)
  ‚úÖ GPU memory clean (0.0GB usage)
  ‚úÖ Queue empty (no pending jobs)
  ‚úÖ Models accessible (network volume)
  ‚úÖ Dependencies working (all imports)

During Testing:
  ‚úÖ Monitor worker logs in real-time
  ‚úÖ Record phase-by-phase timings
  ‚úÖ Track GPU memory usage
  ‚úÖ Verify output file quality
  ‚úÖ Document any errors or issues

After Testing:
  ‚úÖ Calculate performance metrics
  ‚úÖ Update this document
  ‚úÖ Identify optimization opportunities
  ‚úÖ Plan next testing phase
```
