### **Known Issues**
```yaml
Enhanced Video Quality:
  Issue: Enhanced video generation working but quality not great
  Problem: Adult/NSFW enhancement doesn't work well out of the box
  Impact: Adds 60 seconds to video generation
  Solution: Planning to use Qwen for prompt enhancement instead

File Storage Mapping:
  Issue: Job types to storage bucket mapping complexity
  Problem: URL generation and file presentation on frontend
  Impact: SDXL returns 6 images vs WAN returns single file
  Solution: Proper array handling for SDXL, single URL for WAN
```
