# SDXL Worker Run Method Fix

## Problem
The SDXL worker was crashing at startup with the error:
```
❌ SDXL Worker startup failed: 'LustifySDXLWorker' object has no attribute 'run'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a structural problem in the `sdxl_worker.py` file where a function `upload_to_supabase_storage` was defined outside the class, causing the AST parser to incorrectly determine where the class ended. This prevented the `run()`, `start()`, `serve()`, and `launch()` methods from being recognized as part of the class.

## Solution
1. **Moved `upload_to_supabase_storage` function inside the class** - This function was defined outside the class but used by class methods, causing structural confusion.

2. **Added multiple entry point methods** - Added `start()`, `serve()`, and `launch()` methods that all call `run()` for compatibility with different startup scripts.

3. **Improved class structure** - Ensured all methods are properly indented and within the class definition.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Class Structure
- Moved `upload_to_supabase_storage` from standalone function to class method
- Updated the call in `upload_to_storage` method to use `self.upload_to_supabase_storage`

### 2. Added Multiple Entry Points
```python
def start(self):
    """Alternative start method for compatibility with different startup scripts"""
    logger.info("🚀 Starting SDXL Worker via start() method...")
    return self.run()

def serve(self):
    """Alternative serve method for compatibility with different startup scripts"""
    logger.info("🚀 Starting SDXL Worker via serve() method...")
    return self.run()

def launch(self):
    """Alternative launch method for compatibility with different startup scripts"""
    logger.info("🚀 Starting SDXL Worker via launch() method...")
    return self.run()
```

### 3. Improved Main Entry Point
- Added a `main()` function for better modularity
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing startup scripts

## Verification
- ✅ All methods now properly recognized by AST parser
- ✅ `run()`, `start()`, `serve()`, and `launch()` methods available
- ✅ Class structure is valid Python syntax
- ✅ Main entry point properly configured

## Result
The SDXL worker now has:
- A properly structured class with all methods correctly defined
- Multiple entry points for different startup scenarios
- Compatibility with both direct execution and module import
- Proper error handling and logging

The worker should now start correctly without the "object has no attribute 'run'" error.
